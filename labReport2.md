For this screenshot, the handleRequest method used the given URL as the argument. The method utilizes the if statements to check if the URL contains /add. Once it checked that the URL path does contain /add, it splits the query at the "=" and then checks if the characters before the = are an "s" or "count" In this case, as it was "s" it stores the parameters after the equal sign as a new string called **newString** and then increments the number by +1. It then appends the string **newString** to the existing string called **str** which, at this time, is blank.

In this image, we see the same method, handleRequest, being called with the new URL passed as the argumentâ€”the same if block of code is called. Looking at the output, we can see that the returned string **str** shows both the results from our first input, as well as our new input, as well as representing the order of them with the proper number, saved under the **num** variable.

## Part 3

Over the last two weeks, I've learned how to run a server and become better and more familiar with basic Unix commands. Learning the different parts of the URL was interesting, as before this, I did not know what any of it meant.
